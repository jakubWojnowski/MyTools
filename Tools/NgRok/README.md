# ngrok

ngrok is a powerful tool that allows you to expose a local server to the internet securely. It creates a secure tunnel to your localhost, making it easy to test webhooks, share web applications, and develop against local services from anywhere.

## Features

- **Secure Tunnels:** Create secure tunnels to your localhost with HTTPS, ensuring data encryption and security.
- **Custom Subdomains:** Use custom subdomains to create easy-to-remember URLs for your local services.
- **HTTP Inspection:** Inspect HTTP traffic flowing through your tunnels with a web-based user interface, making it easy to debug and troubleshoot.
- **Access Control:** Secure your tunnels with IP whitelisting and password protection, ensuring only authorized users can access your local services.
- **API Integration:** Integrate ngrok with your applications using the ngrok API, allowing you to automate tunnel management and dynamically update tunnel configurations.
- **Persistent URLs:** Create persistent URLs that don't change with each session, making it easy to share links and maintain consistent access to your local services.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** ngrok is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of development environments.

## Example Use Cases

- **Webhook Development:** Test webhooks from services like GitHub, Stripe, and Twilio on your local development environment.
- **Remote Access:** Share your local development server with colleagues or clients for feedback and collaboration.
- **Mobile App Development:** Test and debug mobile applications that require a backend server accessible from the internet.
